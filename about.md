Hi, I’m Sunidhi Ashtekar 👋

An AI Engineer passionate about Computer Vision and increasingly Multimodal / GenAI systems.

I love exploring new models and research trends, running hands-on experiments, and writing clear, practical explanations of what I learn. This blog is where I share notes, deep dives, and projects as I learn in public and build along the way.

Previously, I worked as an ML/CV Engineer at Google on the Perception team for Google AR glasses, where I helped develop and refine computer vision models. Before that, I was on the Perception team at Continental Automotive, building computer vision algorithms for ADAS and autonomous driving.

If you enjoy computer vision, multimodal AI, GenAI, and learning by building, you’ll probably like what I post here.
